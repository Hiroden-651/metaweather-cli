MetaWeather Command Line Utility - by Bradley Maness

Description:
        This command makes use of the MetaWeather API to display a table of current weather information.
        
        More info about the API can be found at "https://www.metaweather.com/api/".

Usage: 
        metaweather [-options] [city name]

Options:    
        -help: Opens this document.

        -q [query term]: Query cities for WOEID(Where on Earth ID) number.

                A query term can be any combination of case-insensitive alphabetic characters. Any
                input containing non-alphabetic characters will return no results.

                If a query returns only one result, the programs asks the user if they wish to display
                the weather for that single location or exit. Choosing to show weather will display a
                6-day forecast for the location. 

                If a query returns multiple locations, the program asks the user to input a WOEID for a
                corresponding location or exit. If a user enters a valid WOEID, the 6-day
                forecast for that location will be displayed.

        -i [woeid]: Get 6-day forcast for city associated with provided WOEID.

                A WOEID is an integer number that corresponds with a specific city queried using the
                -i option. Using a valid WOEID will return a 6-day table of weather information for 
                the associated city. Data points used for this table include the following:

                Date: Day of the week(yyyy/mm/dd).
                Weather State: Brief description of conditions.
                Min/Max/Curr(C): Minimum/maximum/current tempurature in Centigrade.
                WinDir: Compass direction of wind.
                WinSpd(MPH): Wind speed in miles-per-hour.
                AP(mbar): Atmospheric Pressure.
                Humidity: Percentage value for humidity.
                Vis(Miles): Visibility measured in miles.
                Pred: Accuracy percentage of weather predictions.
